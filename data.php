These are the phones that I can compare to, so keep that in mind when reading my review.\n\nMy first impression out of box was that the phone was beautiful. I seriously didn't even want to touch it. I debated between space gray and white silver. I ultimately chose white silver because my wife has a black iPhone 5 and everything electronic I have is black. I though white was refreshing and if I can always put a case on to make it any color I want. I am so happy I chose white. It really makes the phone look fresh - sorry that is the best word I can find to describe it. The colors on the screen pop against the background. It doesn't show finger prints as much as my wives black phone.\n\nI got a clear case for the phone that just adds to the appearance. It also protects it from scratches and drops. In my opinion a case is required for an iPhone 5S. I honestly think that Apple designed it with the intent to use it with a case. Other competitive phones advertise a built in grip or that it feels better to hold than an iPhone, which is probably true. Apple made the phone so thin and light that adding a case just makes it feel better. Where other phones if you add a case it just makes the phone larger and heavier. I personally like putting my phone in a case. It is a way to personalize your phone and protect it. If the case gets dirty or worn, just spent $10 or $20 bucks and buy a new one.",

I wanted the 5 (nice discount and I like the look of the black metal rather than the colored plastic of the 5c) but they were sold out. The store I was at happened to have 1 black (space grey) 16g left so I decided to go for it.\nI was upgrading from the 4s which I still think is a great phone. The 4g/LTE capabilities of the 5s are really great, the larger screen is also really great, but other than that the extras that are 5s exclusive are more of a gimmick at this point. The fingerprint sensor is a nice touch but not a necessity as your phone could still get hijacked. It does work pretty well and I like that you can program up to 5 fingerprints (I have thumb and index for both hands programmed on mine as well as the 4 digit pin) the camera is definitely better in low light, but I don't know of the dual flash actually makes a difference for me that is noticeable. The slow motion video camera is fun but I wish you could do more than one section in slow mo (can decide which section is slow mo but can't split it up. You also can't post slow mo to Instagram which is what I use video for mostly. Haven't tried with vine)",
